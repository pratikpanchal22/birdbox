### Active Birds
The BirdSong Box can play bird songs either on demand (press the button on the BirdSong Box), on a schedule (configurable via settings), or via motion-sense (when the BirdSong Box detects motion, it plays bird songs).
You can get more information (on your phone or laptop via a browser) on which birds you are listening to on the BirdSong Box when they are called by either of these 3 methods.
